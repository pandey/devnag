Velthuis's Devanagari for TeX

The Devanagari for TeX (devnag) package provides a way to typeset high-quality Devanagari text with 
TeX and LaTeX. Devanagari (&#x0926;&#x0947;&#x0935;&#x0928;&#x093E;&#x0917;&#x0930;&#x0940;) is 
a script used for writing and printing Sanskrit and a number of languages in Northern and Central 
India such as Hindi and Marathi, as well as Nepali.

The devnag package was originally developed in May 1991 by Frans Velthuis for the University 
of Groningen, The Netherlands, and it was the first system to provide support for the 
Devanagari script for TeX. Since then, a dedicated team of developers has maintained and 
enhanced the package.

The package is available from the Comprehensive TeX
Archive Network (CTAN), for example at the UK primary site:
